I have created my own personal portfolio website as a landing page. In the head section, the components are home, about, services, skills, projects, contact. When you will click any of these components then content will be shown in the remaining screen. In the "About" section, I have included details about my experience, skills, and education. Clicking on any of these components will display them on the screen. I have provided details about the services I offer and outlined my technical and professional competencies. Furthermore, I have displayed the projects that I have developed. When you click any of them, then you will find comprehensive information about each project. I have included the contact information and contact form in the website footer, allowing users to easily submit the form as well. I have created a website that captures attention and is visually pleasing.
